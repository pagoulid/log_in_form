1) Create db first:
	-required mysql installed
	-access mysql via root : (if succesfully installed type mysql in command promp)
	-first create user : CREATE USER 'panosg'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '%PaGou17846';
	(user: panosg,password: %PaGou17846 )
	-want to give all privileges temporarily to the user so : GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'panosg'@'localhost';
	(SOS!!! ALWAYS before closing mysql we must give back privileges on root so we can access mysql : 
		GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO  'root'@'localhost'; )
- After giving privileges to user create a db in this project i created a 'Mydb' database : CREATE DATABASE MyDB;

2) Create an HTTP server for the login form :
	-the code is in form1.py
	-HTTP server listens on port 3000
	-Access server via browser typing localhost:3000
	-Login form has 2 buttons sign in and sign up:
		sign up to give access and store a new user in the database
		sign in to give access to an existed user in the database
	-There are different scenarios in each case:
		for both sign in and sign up we have the scenarios of giving a username and not giving a password
		and also the opposite scenario(giving a password and not giving a username)(in that case a redirection is made to the login 		form again)
		Specificaly in the sign in scenario we have the cases of:
		giving correct username but wrong password
		giving a username that don't exist in the database
3)create a database server:
	-the code is in DB_server.py
	-the db server must communicate with the http server every time a request is made (only in the case of sign in , sign up )
	- database server listens on port 5000 
4)create a database:
	-the code is in DB.py
	-Create a db instance due to your user and database info 
	-Create a table inside the database to store information about clients(name,hash,salt)
	- the management of the database is made on the db server side

5) Encrypt passwords before storing them:
	-After retrieving info of a new user don't store the password in the db but store
	a hash of the hash of the password plus a given random salt and the  given random salt
	- hash = hash of (salt + hash of password)
	- the code of the encryption algorithm is in randtest.py
